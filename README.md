# Super Mario Bros DEMO!
Super Mario Bros in C++ under SDL2. 

This game is a DEMO with his first world!

# How to compile
Code::Blocks is needed (although with Visual Studio 2019, DevC++ or any other IDE you can use it, if you know how to build the project).

You must also install and include the SDL2 library along with SDL_Image and SDL_Mixer.
